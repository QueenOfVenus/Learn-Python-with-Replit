# Learn-Python-with-Replit
I am doing a 100 day challenge via Replit.



Hey Guys. I am doing a 100 day challenge via Replit. 
During this process, I am putting all the notes I wrote while learning here. 
The codes I wrote definitely contain a lot of humor, SO THEY ARE NOT REFERENCES FOR WORK. 
Because Replit works with a humorous teaching style like me. It includes my training notes. 
If you want to learn while having fun, you can review it.
